# Training for Trifork
* **This repository documents my journey, where i learn the necessary stuff to work for Trifork <3**

## Overview of folders and documents
### Plan - how to learn Java, Docker and Kotlin
 * I have made a pdf, that describes, what I'll study to get ready :))
  
   ![Plan pdf](https://github.com/froemosen/Training-for-Trifork/blob/main/Documents/Plan.pdf)

### Status - how the plan is going
* I have also made three different status-pdf's, that start with a checklist of progress, followed by my personal notes on the subjects (probably not important for others that myself :P). 
  
   - [x] ![JAVA status-pdf](https://github.com/froemosen/Training-for-Trifork/blob/main/Documents/Learning%20Status%20Java.pdf)
  
   - [x] ![DOCKER status-pdf](https://github.com/froemosen/Training-for-Trifork/blob/main/Documents/Learning%20Status%20Docker.pdf)
  
   - [ ] ![KOTLIN status-pdf](https://github.com/froemosen/Training-for-Trifork/blob/main/Documents/Learning%20Status%20Kotlin.pdf)


### Coding (Learning by doing)
* **Initial Ducking Around ([Here](https://github.com/froemosen/Training-for-Trifork/tree/main/Initial%20Ducking%20Around))**
  * Folder containing .java-file with:
    * initial Hello World-program, and
    * a program containing a basic method (other than main).

* **TurtleTest ([Here](https://github.com/froemosen/Training-for-Trifork/tree/main/TurtleTest))**
  * Folder containing a Java-program, that was inspired by an ealier project of mine, that was made in Python. The whole program structure and most of the original functionality has been written in Java, and was based on the [original program](https://github.com/froemosen/Training-for-Trifork/blob/main/TurtleTest/Inspiration/main.py).
  
    The program is able to draw any regular polygon, and also able to draw circles with different radii. To start the program - run "Main".
