### Coding
* **Initial Ducking Around**
  * Folder containing .java-file with initial Hello World and a program containing a basic method (other than main).

* **TurtleTest**
  * Folder containing a java-program that was inspired by an ealier project of mine, that was made in python. The whole program structure and most of the original functionality has been written in java, and was based on the [original program](https://github.com/froemosen/Training-for-Trifork/blob/main/TurtleTest/Inspiration/main.py).
  The program is able to draw any regular polygon, and also able to draw circles with different radii. To start the program; run "Main.java".
